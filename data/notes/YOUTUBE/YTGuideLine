Overview
YouTube has always had a set of Community Guidelines that outline what type of content isn’t allowed on YouTube. These policies apply to all types of content on our platform, including videos, comments, links, and thumbnails. Our Community Guidelines are a key part of our broader suite of policies and are regularly updated in consultation with outside experts and YouTube creators to keep pace with emerging challenges.

We enforce these Community Guidelines using a combination of human reviewers and machine learning, and apply them to everyone equally—regardless of the subject or the creator’s background, political viewpoint, position, or affiliation.

Our policies aim to make YouTube a safer community while still giving creators the freedom to share a broad range of experiences and perspectives.

What areas do Community Guidelines cover?
You'll find a full list of our Community Guidelines below:

Fake engagement policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out this page for a full list of our guidelines.
YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.

Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.

Important:  If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.

We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines are available here. If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can report the channel.

What this policy means for you
If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
Note: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.

How engagement is measured
Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.

A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about our strikes system.

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about channel or account terminations.


Impersonation policy
The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out this page for a full list of our guidelines.
Content intended to impersonate a person or channel is not allowed on YouTube. YouTube also enforces trademark holder rights. When a channel, or content in the channel, causes confusion about the source of goods and services advertised, it may not be allowed.

If you see content that violates this policy, report it.

If you feel that yours or another creator's channel is being impersonated, you can report the channel.
What these policies mean for you
If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below. 

Channel impersonation: A channel that copies another channel's profile, background, or overall look and feel in such a way that makes it look like someone else's channel. The channel does not have to be 100% identical, as long as the intent is clear to copy the other channel.
Personal impersonation: Content intended to look like someone else is posting it.
If you operate a fan channel, make sure you state so explicitly in your channel name or handle. It should be obvious to your viewers that your channel doesn't represent the original creator, artist or entity your channel is celebrating.

Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.

Channels with the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image as another channel, with the only difference being a space inserted into the name or a zero replacing the letter O.
Using someone else's real name, user name, image, brand, logo, or other personal information to trick people into believing you are that person. 
Setting up a channel using the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image of a person, and then pretending that person is posting content to the channel.
Setting up a channel using the name and image of a person, and then posting comments on other channels as if they were posted by the person.
Channels claiming to be a 'fan account' in the channel description, but not stating so clearly in the channel name or handle, or posing as another’s channel and reuploading their content.
Channels impersonating an existing news channel.
Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

This includes titles, thumbnails, or descriptions leading viewers to believe they will see something in a video, but then not including it in the video content itself.
Scams: Content offering cash gifts, “get rich quick” schemes, or pyramid schemes (sending money without a tangible product in a pyramid structure).
Incentivization Spam: Content that sells engagement metrics such as views, likes, comments, or any other metric on YouTube. This type of spam can also include content where the only purpose is to boost subscribers, views, or other metrics. For example, offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel solely in exchange for them subscribing to your channel, also known as "Sub4Sub" content.
Comments Spam: Comments where the sole purpose is to gather personal info from viewers, misleadingly drive viewers off YouTube, or perform any of the prohibited behaviors noted above.

For some violations, we may remove the content and issue a warning or a strike against your channel. If this happens, we’ll send you an email to let you know.

You can take an optional policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days.

Playlists policy
Playlists are a great way to combine videos that your community may want to watch as a series. We know it’s not often intentional, but there may be times when playlists contain content that’s not allowed on the platform and can cause harm to our community. This means that playlists that violate our Community Guidelines are not allowed on YouTube.
Here’s a simple way to think of it: if you were to combine all the playlists’ videos into one single video, and that video were to violate our Community Guidelines, then the playlist may violate Community Guidelines as well.

If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines are available here. If you find many videos, comments, or a creator's entire channel that you wish to report, visit our reporting tool.

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about our strikes system.

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about channel or account terminations.

Harassment & cyberbullying policies

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out this page for a full list of our guidelines.
We don’t allow content that targets someone with prolonged insults or slurs based on their physical traits or protected group status. We also don’t allow other harmful behaviors, like threats or doxxing. Keep in mind that we take a stricter approach on content that targets minors.

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines are available here. If you find many videos or comments that you would like to report, you can report the channel. For tips about how to stay safe, keep your account secure, and protect your privacy, check out the Creator Safety Center and Stay safe on YouTube.

If specific threats are made against you and you feel unsafe, report it directly to your local law enforcement agency.

What this policy means for you
If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

Content that contains prolonged insults or slurs based on someone's intrinsic attributes. These attributes include their protected group status, physical attributes, or their status as a survivor of sexual assault, non-consensual intimate imagery distribution, domestic abuse, child abuse and more.
Content uploaded with the intent to shame, deceive or insult a minor. This means intending to make a minor feel unpleasant emotions, like distress, shame, or worthlessness; intending to trick them to behave in ways that may harm themselves or their property; or engaging in name-calling toward them. A minor is someone under 18 years old.
Other types of content that violate this policy
This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Note that these policies also apply to external links in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video and other forms.

Exceptions
If the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic in nature, we may allow content that includes harassment. These exceptions are not a pass to harass someone. Some examples include:

Debates related to high-profile officials or leaders: Content featuring debates or discussions of topical issues concerning individuals who have positions of power, like high-profile government officials or CEOs of major multinational corporations.
Scripted performances: Insults made in the context of an artistic medium such as scripted satire, stand up comedy, or music (such as a diss track). Note: This exception is not a pass to harass someone and claim “I was joking.”
Harassment education or awareness: Content that features actual or simulated harassment for documentary purposes or with willing participants (such as actors) to combat cyberbullying or raise awareness.
Note: We take a harder line on content that maliciously insults someone based on their protected group status, regardless of whether or not they are a high-profile individual.

Monetization and other penalties
In some rare cases, we may remove content or issue other penalties when a creator:

Repeatedly encourages abusive audience behavior.
Repeatedly targets, insults and abuses an identifiable individual based on their intrinsic attributes across several uploads.
Exposes an individual to risks of physical harm based on the local social or political context.
Creates content that harms the YouTube community by persistently inciting hostility between creators for personal financial gain.
Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube:

Repeatedly showing pictures of someone and then making statements like “Look at this creature’s teeth, they’re so disgusting!”, with similar commentary targeting intrinsic attributes throughout the video.
Targeting an individual based on their membership in a protected group, such as by saying: “Look at this [slur targeting a protected group]!”
Using an extreme insult to dehumanize an individual based on their intrinsic attributes. For example: “Look at this dog of a woman! She’s not even a human being — she must be some sort of mutant or animal!”
Targeting an individual and expressing a wish for their death or serious injury: “I hate her so much. I wish she’d just get hit by a truck and die.”
Depicting an identifiable individual being murdered or seriously injured. For example: A video includes a clip from a movie, where one character is brutally shot and killed. The video is edited so that a real individual’s photo is placed over the actor’s face.
Threatening someone’s physical safety. This includes explicit threats like, “When I see you on Saturday, I’m going to kill you.” This also includes implying violence by making statements like, “You better watch out, I’m coming for you” while brandishing a weapon.
Posting an individual’s non-public personally identifiable information, like a phone number, home address, or email address, to direct abusive attention or traffic toward them. For example, saying, “I got a hold of their phone number. Call and leave messages until they pick up!”
“Raiding” or directing malicious abuse to identifiable individuals through in-game voice chat or messages during a stream.
Directing users to leave abusive comments in another creator's comment section.
Linking to off platform sites that host or feature non-consensual intimate imagery.
Requesting that other users get in touch to share non-consensual intimate imagery.
“Swatting” or other prank calls to emergency or crisis response services, or encouraging viewers to act in this or any other harassing behavior.
Stalking or attempting to blackmail users.
Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) to promote violence against an individual.

This is not a pass to promote misinformation. We may make exceptions if the purpose of the content is to condemn, dispute, or satirize misinformation that violates our policies.

We also allow personal expressions of opinion on the above topics as long as they don’t otherwise violate any of the policies outlined above.

What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. You can learn more about our strikes system here.

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. You can learn more about channel or account terminations here.

Misinformation policies
Certain types of misleading or deceptive content with serious risk of egregious harm are not allowed on YouTube. This includes certain types of misinformation that can cause real-world harm, certain types of technically manipulated content, or content interfering with democratic processes.

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines are available here. If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can report the channel.

What these policies mean for you
If you're posting content
Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions below.

Suppression of census participation: Content aiming to mislead census participants about the time, place, means, or eligibility requirements of the census, or false claims that could materially discourage census participation.
Manipulated content: Content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (usually beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm.
Misattributed content: Content that may pose a serious risk of egregious harm by falsely claiming that old footage from a past event is from a current event.
Examples

Medical misinformation policy
Note: YouTube reviews all its Community Guidelines as a normal course of business.  In our 2023 blog post we announced ending several of our COVID-19 policies and we have now retired the remaining standalone COVID-19 policies given the reduced burden of disease. Our broader Medical Misinformation framework continues to apply to content related to infectious diseases including influenza and measles.
YouTube doesn't allow content that poses a serious risk of egregious harm by spreading medical misinformation that contradicts local health authority (LHA) guidance about specific health conditions and substances. This policy includes the following categories:

Prevention misinformation
Treatment misinformation
Note: YouTube’s medical misinformation policies are subject to change in response to changes to guidance from health authorities. There may be a delay between new guidance and policy updates, and our policies may not cover all LHA guidance related to specific health conditions and substances.

What this policy means for you
Don’t post content on YouTube if it includes any of the following:

Prevention misinformation: We do not allow content that promotes information that contradicts health authority guidance on the prevention or transmission of specific health conditions, or on the safety, efficacy or ingredients of currently approved and administered vaccines.

Treatment misinformation: We do not allow content that promotes information that contradicts health authority guidance on treatments for specific health conditions, including promotion of specific harmful substances or practices that have not been approved by local health authorities as safe or effective, or that have been confirmed to cause severe harm.

These policies apply to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to external links in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

Examples
Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube. This isn't a complete list.

Prevention misinformation
Harmful substances & practices as prevention methods
Vaccine misinformation
Transmission information
Treatment misinformation
Harmful substances & practices as treatment methods
Guaranteed treatment misinformation
Harmful alternative methods & discouragement of professional treatment
Educational, documentary, scientific or artistic content
We may allow content that violates the misinformation policies noted on this page if that content includes additional context in the video, audio, title, or description. This is not a pass to promote misinformation. Additional context may include countervailing views from local health authorities or medical experts. We may also make exceptions if the purpose of the content is to condemn, dispute, or satirize misinformation that violates our policies. We may also make exceptions for content discussing the results of a specific medical study, or showing an open public forum, like a protest or public hearing, provided the content does not aim to promote misinformation that violates our policies.

YouTube also believes people should be able to share their own experiences, including personal experiences with vaccinations, for example. This means we may make exceptions for content in which creators describe firsthand experiences from themselves or their family. At the same time, we recognize there is a difference between sharing personal experiences and promoting misinformation. To address this balance, we will still remove content or channels if they include other policy violations or demonstrate a pattern of promoting medical misinformation.

What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link.

How YouTube evaluates Educational, Documentary, Scientific & Artistic (EDSA) content
Our Community Guidelines aim to make YouTube a safer community. Sometimes, content that would otherwise violate our Community Guidelines may stay on YouTube when it has Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic (EDSA) context. In these cases, the content gets an EDSA exception. This article has tips for how you can add context—more information that informs or educates viewers—to your EDSA content.

Note: Adding context to your EDSA content doesn’t guarantee that it will get an EDSA exception.
How content gets an EDSA exception
We assess whether content gets an EDSA exception on a case-by-case basis. First, we check if there’s a Community Guidelines violation in the content. If there’s a violation, we review if there’s enough context in the content to make an EDSA exception. We review WHAT context is present and WHERE the context is.

What context to add to your EDSA content
The type of context you must include to get an EDSA exception depends on what’s in the content.

We make most EDSA exceptions when content has one or more of the following:

1. Basic facts about what’s happening in the content: Identify who’s in the content, describe what the content shows or when and where it takes place, or explain why certain content is present.

Examples of basic facts
2. Condemnation, opposing views, or satire: Communicate that your content condemns certain claims, includes opposing points of view, or is satirical.

Examples of condemnation, opposing views, or satire
3. Discouragement of dangerous behavior: Tell viewers not to imitate what’s in the video.

Examples of discouraging dangerous behavior
Note: The above examples aren't a complete list of the context that you can add to your EDSA content. When in doubt, add multiple forms of context to your EDSA content. To help prevent content from causing harm, include the info in your video, not just your video’s title or description.

When in doubt, include different types of context described above: basic factual information that explains what’s in your content, multiple points of view, and clear and informative discouragement against imitating dangerous or harmful behavior. Be sure to include this information in the content itself, like the video or audio, to help avoid the content potentially causing harm.

In some cases, we may make EDSA exceptions to allow certain content based on public interest. This could include, for example, content like national political candidates on the campaign trail, graphic footage from active warzones or humanitarian crises, or comments disputing health authority guidance made during a public hearing. We may apply an age restriction or warning to content even if it gets an EDSA exception because it may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 (e.g. violent crime footage in a documentary).

WHERE to add context to your EDSA content
You can add context to your:

Video
For example, you can add footage or text overlays.
Audio
For example, you can add narration including condemnation or a countervailing point of view.
Video title
Video description
Note: We may not make EDSA exceptions for context that may be in comments, tags, channel descriptions, pinned comments, or other surfaces. That content isn’t always visible to viewers.
Important: For content that risks the most harm, we require context in the VIDEO or AUDIO. The video and audio are the parts of the content where viewers will most likely get the context, including when the content is embedded on other websites or apps. Content where we require context in the audio or video to give an EDSA exception includes content related to hate speech, violent criminal organizations, child safety, suicide and self-harm, and graphic violence.
What about other types of content, like comments?

The same policies and guidelines that apply to videos also apply to other types of content.

Content that may not get EDSA exceptions
Certain content may not be allowed on YouTube, even if it has context added.

Child Sexual Abuse Media (CSAM)
Video, still imagery, or audio of violent physical sexual assaults
The act of decapitation
Footage filmed by the perpetrator of a deadly or major violent event that shows weapons, violence, or injured victims
Unmodified reuploads of content created by or glorifying violent terrorist or criminal organizations

Instructions on how to use computers or information technology to compromise personal data or cause serious harm to others
Content that reveals an individual’s private information, such as their home address, email addresses, sign-in credentials, phone numbers, passport number, or bank account information (doxxing)
Hardcore pornography
Spam


Being accepted into the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) is a major milestone in any Creator’s journey. As part of YPP, Creators can start monetizing their content, receive email and chat support, and get access to the Copyright Match Tool to help protect their content.

A key eligibility requirement for YPP is to follow YouTube monetization policies, which include YouTube’s Community Guidelines, Terms of Service, and Google AdSense program policies. These policies apply to a Creator’s channel as a whole, and not just individual videos.

Setting a higher bar for monetization
Over the last few years, YouTube has taken steps to strengthen the requirements for monetization so that spammers, impersonators, and other bad actors can’t hurt the ecosystem or take advantage of good Creators producing high quality content.

To apply for membership in YPP, channels must meet eligibility thresholds related to watch time and subscribers. Following application, YouTube’s review team ensures the channel has not run afoul of YouTube’s monetization, content, and copyright policies. Only channels that meet eligibility thresholds and follow all of our guidelines will be admitted to the program, which makes them eligible to receive access to ads and other monetization products.
