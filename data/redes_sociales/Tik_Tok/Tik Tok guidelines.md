## Overview
TikTok is a source of entertainment and enrichment where you can discover, create, and connect with others across the world. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy.

We have Community Guidelines to create a welcoming, safe, and entertaining experience. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They include rules for what is allowed on TikTok, as well as standards for what is eligible for the For You feed (FYF). To address new risks and harms, the guidelines are updated on an ongoing basis.
